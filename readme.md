# GitHub Codespaces ‚ô•Ô∏è .NET 8

This repo builds a Weather API using Minimal APIs, opens Swagger so you can call and test the API, and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET 8. 

We've given you both a frontend and backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you‚Äôre ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we‚Äôll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Getting started

1. Once you open the project in VS CODE in the terminal, you need to select the project to run.(*cd Api1*)
2. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run project**: 
Then in the terminal you need to write dotnet *watch run*
Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded ports [*8080* and *8081*](https://humble-zebra-77w5g7vp99fq4-5008.app.github.dev/swagger/index.html) in your browser. 


4. **üîÑ Iterate quickly:** Codespaces updates the server on each save, and VS Code's debugger lets you dig into the code execution.

5. To stop running, return to VS Code, and click Stop twice in the debug toolbar. 

Once you open the project in VS CODE in the terminal, you need to select the project to run.
